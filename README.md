Idea:

Given:

	- A _base hexagram_ for each individual.
	- A random line generator.

Set:

	- Expectation of each individual about the next draw based on comparison with its own _base hexagram_.

		The comparison is based on hexagram closest similarity (as in this [other project](https://github.com/fde-capu/ICR)).

Then draw a line, and get:

	- Level of satisfaction about the drawn line.

Note on style:

This is old code made way before I take any formal approach to programming. Back then, the compacter, the better.

If you wish, have fun with the project. You may only elaborate on the concept with my participation. If you take conclusions of your own, let me know and let us build something neat.
